Literature quality evaluation (graph neural networks in the field of traffic prediction)
As NOS tables are rarely used in the literature related to deep learning and artificial intelligence, and the three common discriminatory directions of NOS tables are (1) selection, (2) comparability, (3) outcome variables. These discriminatory directions and scoring criteria are not applicable to research on graph neural networks in the field of traffic prediction. To enable a more accurate quality evaluation of the included literature, the NOS table is improved in this paper so that it can be applied to the study of graph neural networks in the field of traffic prediction. First, the discriminatory directions in the NOS table are modified by replacing the three discriminatory directions in medicine with "data", "experiment" and "conclusion" respectively. The criteria for each direction were then set. Finally, the quality of the included literature was assessed according to the discriminatory criteria, the higher the number of "*", the higher the quality. The discriminatory conditions for the three directions are as follows.
